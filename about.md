Thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me. I'm Jeff.

I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of Oregon, expecting to graduate after Winter 2016. I'm currently interning as a Front-end Developer at Azuqua in Seattle, WA, working on a product development tool.

I was a board member with the UO Web Development Club, and am leading it this year through a pivot and rebrand to become the UO Dev Club, for general software development. Check out our website... when it's done being under construction.

Coding, strength training, and spending time with friends is what makes my life worth living. I like to believe I can still play the trumpet, too.

I'll have more content for you soon. If you'd like to contact me in the meantime, shoot me a message on your favorite social media platform. Links are on the bottom of this page.
