### Green Garter Band (GGB)

I played 2nd trumpet in the [University of Oregon Green Garter Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Garter_Band) from 2012-14. GGB is a subset of the Oregon Athletic Bands; we share duties with the Yellow Garter Band to play at all women's volleyball games, women's basketball games, and we all play at all home football and basketball games, plus post-season travel. 

During the Spring season, GGB spends time reaching out to Oregon high schools to encourage them to pursue both higher education, and to continue with music in some capacity throughout life. Since we're about a 50/50 split between Music and other majors, the non-Music majors (like myself) can serve as an example of how to continue with music despite not pursuing it as a career.

Featured below are two songs I soloed over in our 2013 Spring recording session.
