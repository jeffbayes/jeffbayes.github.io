## I'm back!

I'm certain that no one is following this, since my personal website has been defunct for at least two years (if not longer). I've been inspired by the forced time alone here in Seattle, and felt the itch to get this site back in commission. Hopefully I'll have things cleaned up soon and have thoughts to share and bones to pick. Until then, I'm glad to be back.

(For what it's worth, this post is just to see if a forced re-compile reboots my github page. If you see this, it probably worked. Or I forgot to update this with how to revive these blogs. One of the two. [Update: didn't work - issue was DNS resolution. Seems like GitHub Pages changed their IP addresses in the Microsoft acquisition?])
