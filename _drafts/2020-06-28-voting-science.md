# Voting Science

I don't think I'm inspiring much vitriol when I say the current voting system in the United States - plurality "winner take all," or "first past the post" - leads to some terrible election outcomes. I've developed an interest in alternative voting systems, and am coming in with relatively fresh eyes. I've heard quite a bit about Instant Runoff Voting or Ranked Choice Voting, and have heard more about other initatives such as STAR, Range, Score, and others that a bunch of nerds (like me) spend their time obsessing over the differences. First, we'll take a look at what criterion are regularly used in comparing voting systems, and why they seem important. Second, we'll evaluate our current voting systems against those criterion. Third, we'll look at some of the most popular voting alternatives, and what seems to be the clearest improvements.

## Voting System Criterion

- Condorcet Winner
- Majority
  - Relaxed Majority
