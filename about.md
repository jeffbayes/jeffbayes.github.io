Thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me. I'm Jeff.

I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of Oregon, expecting to graduate after Winter 2016. I have interned as a Front-end Developer at Azuqua in Seattle, WA, working on a product development tool. I brought the University of Oregon Web Development Club from once-per-term meetings to productive weekly meetings, hosting an annual hackathon, and expanding the scope from web development to general software development.

I consider myself somewhere between a project manager and a full stack developer with a front-end slant. In my experience, project management and front-end development are all about asking the right questions.

I was a board member with the UO Web Development Club, and am leading it this year through a pivot and rebrand to become the UO Dev Club, for general software development. Check out our website... when it's done being under construction.

Coding, strength training, and spending time with friends is what makes my life worth living. I like to believe I can still play the trumpet, too. Check out some of the music I've worked on by heading to my [music page]({{site.url}}/music).

I'll have more content for you soon. 

If you'd like to contact me in the meantime, shoot me a message on your favorite social media platform. Links are on the bottom of this page.
