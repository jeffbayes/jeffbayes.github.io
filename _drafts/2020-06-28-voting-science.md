# Voting Science

I don't think I'm inspiring much vitriol when I say the current voting system in the United States - plurality "winner take all," or "first past the post" - leads to some terrible election outcomes. I've developed an interest in alternative voting systems, and am coming in with relatively fresh eyes. I've heard quite a bit about Instant Runoff Voting or Ranked Choice Voting, and have heard more about other initatives such as STAR, Range, Score, and others that a bunch of nerds (like me) spend their time obsessing over the differences. First, we'll take a look at what criterion are regularly used in comparing voting systems, and why they seem important. Second, we'll evaluate our current voting systems against those criterion. Third, we'll look at some of the most popular voting alternatives, and what seems to be the clearest improvements.

## Voting System Criteria
A voting method criterion refers to whether a voting method can behave in a certain undesirable way. If the method can’t ever behave in the undesirable way, then it is said to pass that criterion. But if it can behave in the undesirable way in any circumstance, then the method fails that criterion. This failure is recognized regardless of the undesirable behavior’s degree or frequency.

**Condorcet Winner**: The Condorcet criterion is satisfied if when a candidate can beat every other candidate in a head-to-head election, that beat-all candidate always wins. If there is a Condorcet winner, i.e. a candidate C who is scored above R on more than 50% of the ballots (for every rival R, albeit the ballot-set is allowed to depend on R), then C must win.

**Favorite Betrayal**: The favorite betrayal criterion is satisfied if a voter’s ballot always benefits by showing the greatest support for a favorite candidate.

**Independence of Clones**: The independence of clones criterion is satisfied if an otherwise winning candidate is not caused to lose by introducing an identical candidate.

**Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives**: IIA is satisfied if adding an additional non-winning candidate can never change the winner.

**Later-No-Harm**: The later-no-harm criterion is satisfied if a voter cannot cause a more preferred candidate to lose by giving an additional ranking or positive rating to a less preferred candidate.

**Monotonicity**: The monotonicity criterion is satisfied if (1) giving greater support for a candidate can never hurt that candidate, and (2) giving less support for a candidate can never benefit that candidate.

**Weak Majority**: The majority criterion is satisfied if when more than half of voters prefer a candidate, voters can always strategically vote so that (absolute) majority candidate wins.

**Majority**: The majority criterion is satisfied if when more than half of voters prefer a candidate, that (absolute) majority candidate always wins.

**Relaxed Majority**: A voting system satisfies the Relaxed Majority Criterion if a majority faction of voters can express a non-zero "maximum support - 1" to a second choice candidate, and still guarantee that the majority faction's "maximum supported" first choice wins.

**Bayesian Regret**: Bayesian regret is a utility value output produced through simulated elections. This approach creates a quantitative measure of voter satisfaction while comparing different voting methods. The simulation allows simultaneous interactions of other variables such as tactical voting, voter ignorance, and number of issues.
