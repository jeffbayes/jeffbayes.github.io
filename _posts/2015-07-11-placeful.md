Source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/uowebdev/placeful" target="_blank">here</a> on Github, and the application is hosted <a href="https://placeful.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a> on Heroku.

My friend Nathan Pointer and I developed an application as a tutorial to show people how to use Flask. This was also our first time working with Flask - we're using it on recommendation of Jeremy Klein. I did the majority of the back-end work, while he made the pretty interface. Placeful is an entirely anonymous location-based message platform for the web. It shows all messages sent within a 3 mile radius.

A quick note: I recently discovered how SQLite works, and why Heroku doesn't play nicely with it. As a result, the database isn't particularly persistent. After an hour (or perhaps less) of no activity, Heroku turns the instance off and resets the database. Think of it as the lovechild of Yik Yak and Snapchat. It's definitely a feature, not a bug.

Enjoy!
