Happy 2016!

Things have been absolutely crazy lately. QuackHack was an enormous success, my final term of school is going well, and I have no idea what I'm planning to do after I graduate. I hope to update you all soon as to what is going on with my life, developing, hackathons, and all else. Since I don't have any real content to share, I thought I would at least share an impactful blog post I read today:

I think it's a real problem that those who grow up in poverty have so much more work to do to even get to the right mindset where it's OK to take risks as an entrepreneur. I certainly don't have an answer, but I think it's something to seriously think about. If more people who started in poverty were able to start businesses, the amount of value created here in the USA would be astronomically higher.

That's all I've got for now. Take care!
