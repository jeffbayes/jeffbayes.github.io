I recently had the opportunity to meet a whole bunch of fellow Seattle-area interns. Last Wednesday, the Seattle outpost of Facebook hosted a release party for the 6th edition of Gayle Laakmann McDowell's _Cracking the Coding Interview_. I was already fairly fond of the book, and it seemed like it could be an exciting event - an opportunity to pick up a book I'd probably buy anyway, plus plenty of interns and other tech workers were sure to be there. And let's be real - I couldn't pass up the chance to check out Facebook's offices, either.
